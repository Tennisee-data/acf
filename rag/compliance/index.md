# Compliance Documentation

Curated compliance guides covering regional requirements for web applications.

## Documents

- [Cookie Compliance Guide](cookies.md) - GDPR, CCPA, PIPEDA requirements

## Purpose

Unlike API documentation which can be fetched from official sources, compliance requirements:
- Vary by jurisdiction
- Require synthesis from multiple legal sources
- Need practical implementation guidance

These documents provide developer-focused summaries with code patterns.

## Disclaimer

This documentation is for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. Always consult qualified legal counsel for compliance decisions.

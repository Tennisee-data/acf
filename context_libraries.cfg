# Context Libraries Configuration
# ================================
# List libraries to always include in context analysis.
# One library per line. Lines starting with # are comments.
#
# Example:
# requests
# fastapi
# sqlalchemy
# pydantic
#
# These libraries will be prioritized when the context agent
# analyzes your codebase for relevant imports and dependencies.
